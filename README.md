# InterviewPrepAI
**Python project using Django and the Google Gemini API to provide interview questions based on given information.**

Hosts a local site that asks for some base personal information and your resume. Also asks for some base info about the interviewer and the position you're applying for.
*requires an API key for Google Gemini*

Will then direct to a page with the responses.
